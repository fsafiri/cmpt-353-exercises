# CMPT 353 - Computational Data Science Problems 
This repository documents my personal work for CMPT 353 (Computational Data Science). It includes my solutions to various exercises and assignments from the course, along with example outputs and
the grades I received for each.

You are welcome to use this repository as a reference for learning purposes, but I strongly discourage copying or directly using my work for assignments or projects.
