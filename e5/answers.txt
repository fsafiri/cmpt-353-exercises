1-The closest transform to ttest assumptions was the square root transformation
which improved normality and variance assumptions.

2-For original ttest rejecting the null suggests weekdays and weekends have 
significantly different comment counts.
For transformed data ttest rejecting means the same, but the result is more 
reliable due to better assumptions (normality and equal variances)

3- The weekly aggregation ttest offers a clearer and more robust answer by 
reducing the daily variability of the data

4-On average more comments are posted on weekdays 1823.6 compared to weekends 
1269.5
