1. The intermediate result filtered was cached  because it is reused multiple times in later transformations and joins. Without caching, spark would recompute filtered every
time it was needed which will increas runtime significantly due to repeated computations.
2. Without broadcast: 
real    1m0.125s
user    0m37.701s
sys     0m3.127s

with the broadcast: 
real    0m50.360s
user    0m46.032s
sys     0m3.447s
